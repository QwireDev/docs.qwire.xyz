# Music Commands

These commands allow you to play music in voice channels with the bot and search songs on YouTube, SoundCloud, Vimeo, etc.

The bot needs to be able to connect to the Voice Channel and to be able to speak in it to play music.

The summon and forceskip commands require you to have the DJ role or the Manage Channels permission.

Permissions required to use certain commands will vary whether or not you are alone in a voice channel.
